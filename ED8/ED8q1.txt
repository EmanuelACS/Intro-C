What is the difference between local and global (extern) variables?

Local variables are declared inside a function, and have a scope limited to that function.
They can only be accessed by the statements inside the function in which they are declared.
They are created when the function is entered and destroyed when it is exited.
Whereas global variables are declared outside of any function, have a scope in the whole program,
can be accessed by any statements within the program, and are never flushed until program is 
done executing.



Describe situations in which you would use each type of variable.

You would use global variables when multiple functions would need access to them,
whereas you would use local variables when they are used within a single function.



Why do most programmers try to avoid using global variables?

Because they can be altered by any part of the code, making it hard to remember the reason in changed.
It makes testing programs harder, fills up the program's namespace and it is much easier to have more
subtle bugs because of them.
