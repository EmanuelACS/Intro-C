/* File ED7q3.c reads from */

For the purpose of this assignment a word is defined to be any string of letters
 or numbers not separated by spaces or punctuation. For example, "hello" and "321"
 are each a single word, but "555-1212" and "C1A 4P3" are each two words.
 Another way to look at this is that you are inside a word if the currently character
 is an alphanumeric. You are between words if the character is not an alphanumeric. 

Then: Modify your answer to question 2, above.

15 uppercase characters
