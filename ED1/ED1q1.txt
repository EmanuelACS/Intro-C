1. Based on the material in chapter 1 or other sources of information, 
what feature of C sounds most exciting to you? What aspects worry you? 
Why? (There is no "right" answer to this question. Just explain your perspective in 2-4 sentences.)

The dynamic memory allocation that c offers seems to create many new options that you wouldn't have in other programming
languages like Java or C# which have automatic memory allocation, and I'm excited to learn how to use this feature. However,
this is also what worries me, as it seems much harder to debug than other code, and much easier to make mistakes especially 
when dealing with arrays'.
