/* nonvalid array assignment */
#define SIZE 5
int main(void)
{
    int oxen[SIZE] = {5,3,2,8};    /* ok here      */
    int yaks[SIZE];
 
    yaks = oxen;                   /* not allowed  */
    yaks[SIZE] = oxen[SIZE];       /* out of range */
    yaks[SIZE] = {5,3,2,8};        /* doesn't work */
}

In the above program, this statement: yaks[SIZE] = oxen[SIZE] is invalid. Why is that statement invalid?

First of all, since SIZE is 5, doing yaks[5] = oxen[5] is trying to assign the 6th element of the oxen array
to the 6th element of the yaks array. Both arrays only have 5 slots allocated, therefore, it is out of range for both.
